FunkRadio is a linux bash script for listening international news and your own favorite music.

funkRadio - world news and your favorite music
Listening to radio can be a laid-back way to keep yourself up to date with world events. However, broadcast radio cannot take into account individual music preferences of individuals. So sooner or later we turn the radio off.

These project presents a Linux bash shell script that combines the best of both worlds -- up-to-date international news and your favorite music.

The script is called funkRadio. You can use it to download and present news broadcasts from internet radio stations. Music comes by the courtesy of your own favourite mp3 files.

## Setting up the funkRadio script
The funkRadio.sh script has been tested in Arch Linux, Debian and Ubuntu environments. Other Linux distributions are probably OK as long as you can install these packages:

vlc (includes cvlc)
wget
mpg123
ffmpeg (includes speechnorm filter)
youtube-dl
curl
shuf
bc (for calculations)
After installing these packages, please create new directories in your home directory by typing on the terminal:

mkdir ~/funkRadio ~/funkRadio/Archive ~/funkRadio/Talk 
Then download or copy the script funkRadio.sh and place it in the folder ~funk/Radio. Activate the script for later use with the command

chmod u+x  ~/funkRadio/funkRadio.sh
Then, create a log file:

touch ~/funkRadio/Archive/funkRadiolog.txt
If you have a music playlist of the m3u format, please place a copy of it in the folder ~/funkRadio/. In this case you will not need to make a playlist when you launch funkRadio for the first time.

## Lauching funkRadio and making a music playlist

If there is no music playlist available, please check in which directory you have your mp3 files (usually ~/Music).

It is OK if your mp3 files are in subdirectories. You will be asked to indicate that directory when running funkRadio for the first time - or later on - when you want to make a new playlist.

funkRadio is launched by typing on the terminal

~/funkRadio/funkRadio.sh
If there is no music playlist in the directory ~/funkRadio/, the script helps you to create one. First, it will guide you to select a directory which, or its subdirectories, contain mp3 files.

The script shows you directories of your home directory with an assigned number. You are asked to select a directory by typing the associated number.

Perhaps you want to include only relatively short songs? You can set a time limit in minutes if you choose that option.

The last stage in preparing the playlist is to type one or more keywords (music directories, artists, etc) for locating those mp3 files that will be included in the playlist.

The making of the playlist is started when you type 'start' instead of another keyword.

When the playlist is ready, your terminal will show you the funkRadio control panel.

## funkRadio Control Panel
The control panel presents a number of options and associated numbers used to select those options.

You can select a station from which the latest news broadcast will be downloaded. Try option '1' - it downloads some news broadcasts in English.

After having selected stations, you can start to listen to news and music by selecting option '13 Listen to the funkRadio'.

While listening, you can toggle between music and news by typing 'Ctrl + C'.

You can turn the radio off by typing 'CTRL + Z'. The command sends the program to the background. Or you can select the last option on the control panel.
